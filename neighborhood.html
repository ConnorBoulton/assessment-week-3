            My neighborhood is situated in northwest corner of Middle Earth.
            In a place known as the Shire. Here, many hobbits keep to themselves and love their peace and quiet.
            We are an agricultural based society and is 120 miles east to west and 150 miles from north to south.
        </p>
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p class="cool-font">
            The shire was first founded by hobbits in the year 1601 of the Third Age. Our founders were brothers,
            Marcho and Blano, who traversed the Misty Mountains, living in the wilds of Eriador before settling the Shire.
        </p>
        <p class="cool-font">
            The shire was a part of Arthedain and a part of Arnor. Hobbits thought of themselves as subject to King 
            Argeleb ii at Norbury, and even sent reinforcements of archers to the great battles Arnor fought against the
            Witch-king of Angmar.
